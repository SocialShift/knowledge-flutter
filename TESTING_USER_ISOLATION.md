# Testing User Isolation for Subscriptions

This guide will help you test that subscriptions are properly isolated between different app users on the same device.

## üß™ **Test Scenarios**

### Test 1: Basic User Isolation
1. **Login as User A** and subscribe to premium
2. **Verify**: User A has premium access and `is_premium: true` in backend
3. **Logout** User A
4. **Login as User B** (different account)
5. **Expected**: User B should NOT have premium access
6. **Expected**: User B's profile should have `is_premium: false`

### Test 2: Purchase Attempt by Second User
1. **Complete Test 1** above
2. **As User B**, try to purchase a subscription
3. **Expected**: Apple payment dialog should appear normally
4. **Expected**: User B can complete their own purchase
5. **Expected**: Both users should now have independent premium access

### Test 3: Cross-User Entitlement Check
1. **Login as User A** with active subscription
2. **Check RevenueCat dashboard**: Note User A's customer ID
3. **Logout and login as User B**
4. **Check RevenueCat dashboard**: User B should have different customer ID
5. **Expected**: User B should not inherit User A's entitlements

### Test 4: Device Switching
1. **User A subscribes on Device 1**
2. **User A logs in on Device 2**
3. **Expected**: User A should have premium on Device 2
4. **User B logs in on Device 1**
5. **Expected**: User B should NOT have premium (despite Device 1 having active subscription)

## üîç **Debug Steps**

### Check RevenueCat Logs
Look for these log messages in your debug console:

```
// User login
‚úÖ "Logged out previous RevenueCat user"
‚úÖ "RevenueCat user logged in: [userId]"
‚úÖ "Customer entitlements: [entitlement_keys]"

// User logout
‚úÖ "RevenueCat user logged out successfully"
‚úÖ "Anonymous customer entitlements: []"

// Entitlement validation
‚úÖ "Entitlement validation for user: [userId]"
‚úÖ "Active entitlements: [entitlement_keys]"
‚úÖ "Premium status updated to true after entitlement validation"

// Error cases
‚ùå "Active subscription found but entitlement validation failed"
‚ùå "Purchase succeeded but no active entitlements found"
```

### Backend API Verification
Monitor these API calls:

```bash
# Should only happen when entitlement is validated
PATCH /auth/profile/update
{
  "is_premium": "true"
}

# Should NOT happen when user switches without subscription
# (No PATCH call should be made)
```

### RevenueCat Dashboard Checks
1. Go to RevenueCat Dashboard ‚Üí Customers
2. Search for each test user
3. Verify each user has separate customer records
4. Check that entitlements are tied to correct users

## üö® **Common Issues & Fixes**

### Issue: User B gets premium without paying
**Cause**: Entitlement validation not working
**Check**: Look for logs showing failed validation
**Fix**: Ensure proper user logout/login sequence

### Issue: No Apple payment dialog for User B
**Cause**: Purchase still tied to device, not user
**Check**: RevenueCat dashboard for duplicate customer entries
**Fix**: Ensure `Purchases.logOut()` is called before user switch

### Issue: Premium status not updating
**Cause**: Backend API call failing
**Check**: Network logs for PATCH request failures
**Fix**: Check API endpoint and FormData format

## üìã **Checklist for Production**

Before releasing user isolation fix:

- [ ] Test with 2+ different Apple ID accounts
- [ ] Test on multiple physical devices
- [ ] Test with TestFlight builds (not just local debug)
- [ ] Verify RevenueCat webhook events are per-user
- [ ] Test restore purchases for each user independently
- [ ] Monitor backend logs for proper `is_premium` updates
- [ ] Test subscription cancellation per user
- [ ] Verify family sharing doesn't cause cross-contamination

## üîß **Development Tips**

### Clear RevenueCat State
If testing gets confused, clear RevenueCat state:

```dart
// In debug builds only
await Purchases.logOut();
// Then restart app
```

### Test User IDs
Use clear, distinct user IDs for testing:
- `test_user_1@example.com`
- `test_user_2@example.com`

### Monitor Network Traffic
Use tools like Charles Proxy to monitor:
- RevenueCat API calls
- Your backend API calls
- Apple StoreKit requests

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

The fix is successful when:

1. ‚úÖ Each app user has completely separate RevenueCat customer records
2. ‚úÖ Subscriptions don't carry over between users on same device
3. ‚úÖ Premium status updates only happen after entitlement validation
4. ‚úÖ Backend `is_premium` field accurately reflects current user's status
5. ‚úÖ Multiple users can purchase independently on same device
6. ‚úÖ Restore purchases works correctly per user
