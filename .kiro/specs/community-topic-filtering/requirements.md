# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement topic-based filtering functionality for the Community Screen. Users will be able to filter communities by selecting specific topic categories, allowing them to discover communities that match their interests. The filtering will work with the existing categories UI and the `topics` field from the community API response.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing communities, I want to filter communities by topic categories, so that I can quickly find communities that match my specific interests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps on a category in the categories section THEN the system SHALL filter the displayed communities to show only those containing the selected topic
2. WHEN a user taps on an already selected category THEN the system SHALL deselect the category and show all communities again
3. WHEN no communities match the selected category THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
4. WHEN multiple categories are selected THEN the system SHALL show communities that match ANY of the selected topics (OR logic)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback when I select topic filters, so that I can clearly see which filters are currently active.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a category is selected THEN the category button SHALL display with highlighted styling (lime green background and navy blue border)
2. WHEN a category is not selected THEN the category button SHALL display with default styling
3. WHEN categories are selected THEN the "Explore Communities" section header SHALL show the count of filtered results
4. WHEN no filters are active THEN the section header SHALL show the total count of all communities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the filtering to work seamlessly with the existing loading and error states, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of data loading status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN communities are loading THEN category selection SHALL be disabled until data is loaded
2. WHEN there is an error loading communities THEN category selection SHALL be disabled
3. WHEN filtering is applied and communities are refreshed THEN the selected filters SHALL persist
4. WHEN the screen is rebuilt THEN the selected category state SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily clear all active filters, so that I can quickly return to viewing all communities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple categories are selected THEN there SHALL be a visual indicator showing active filters
2. WHEN filters are active THEN users SHALL be able to clear all filters with a single action
3. WHEN all filters are cleared THEN all communities SHALL be displayed again
4. WHEN filters are cleared THEN all category buttons SHALL return to their default state
