# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Update state management for multiple category selection
  - Change `selectedCategoryId` from `String?` to `Set<String> selectedCategoryIds`
  - Update the state variable initialization in `_CommunityScreenState`
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 2. Implement community filtering logic
  - Create `filteredCommunities` getter method that filters communities based on selected categories
  - Implement topic matching logic that checks if community topics array contains any selected category names
  - Handle edge cases where topics field might be null or empty
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 3.2_

- [ ] 3. Update category selection handler
  - Modify `_buildCategoriesSection` to use new multi-select logic
  - Update category tap handler to add/remove categories from the Set
  - Implement visual feedback for multiple selected categories
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 4. Update communities grid to use filtered data
  - Modify `_buildCommunitiesSection` to use `filteredCommunities` instead of raw communities data
  - Update the communities grid builder to work with filtered results
  - Ensure loading and error states still work correctly with filtering
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 5. Update UI feedback and result counts
  - Modify communities section header to show filtered count vs total count
  - Update the "X Active" badge to show "X of Y" when filters are applied
  - Ensure proper styling for selected vs unselected category states
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 6. Implement empty state for filtered results
  - Create empty state widget for when no communities match selected filters
  - Add "Clear Filters" action in empty state
  - Ensure empty state integrates well with existing error state handling
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 7. Add filter clearing functionality
  - Implement method to clear all selected categories at once
  - Add visual indicator when filters are active (optional clear all button)
  - Ensure filter state resets properly when cleared
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 8. Handle loading and error states with filtering
  - Disable category selection during loading states
  - Disable category selection during error states
  - Ensure selected filters persist through data refresh operations
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 9. Test and refine filtering behavior
  - Test multiple category selection combinations
  - Verify OR logic works correctly (communities matching ANY selected topic)
  - Test edge cases like communities with no topics or null topics
  - Ensure performance is acceptable with large community lists
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 3.4_

- [ ] 10. Polish UI and accessibility
  - Ensure proper color contrast for selected/unselected states
  - Add appropriate semantic labels for screen readers
  - Test touch targets and interaction feedback
  - Verify consistent styling across light/dark themes
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_
